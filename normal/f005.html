This course intends to show you that software design is very logical and modular. It is a good case study of good engineering practice.            </li>
            <li><p>A lot of software development is intimately tied to computer architectures:</p><ul><li class="outlineTitle9outline2">Compilers generate code for certain processors</li><li class="outlineTitle9outline2">Operating systems control the system hardware</li><li class="outlineTitle9outline2">Motors are often controlled by software</li></ul></li>
            <li>Many <i>embedded systems</i> (from cars, mobile phones and TVs down to microwave ovens and washing machines) need both hardware and software.</li>
