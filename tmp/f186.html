          <p>Infinite loops are caused when the loop-continuation condition in a <tt>while, for</tt> or <tt>do...while</tt> statement never becomes false.
             To prevent this, make sure there is not a semicolon immediately after the header of a <tt>while</tt> or <tt>for</tt> statement. </p>
          <p>In a counter-controlled loop, make sure the control variable is incremented in the loop. In a sentinel-controlled loop,
             make sure the sentinel value is eventually input. </p>
