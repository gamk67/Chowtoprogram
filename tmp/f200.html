          <p>When an equality expression has a variable and a constant, as in <tt>x == 1</tt>, some programmers prefer to write the expression with the constant on the left and the variable name on the right (e.g. <tt>1 == x)</tt> as protection against the logic error that occurs when you accidentally replace operator <tt>==</tt> with <tt>=</tt>.</p>
