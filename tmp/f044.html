          <p>Multiple-word variable names can help make a program more readable.
             Avoid running the words together as in <tt>totalcommissions.</tt>
             Rather, separate the words with underscores as in <tt>total_commissions</tt>,
             or begin each word after the first with a capital letter as in <tt>totalCommissions.</tt>
             The latter style is preferred.</p>
